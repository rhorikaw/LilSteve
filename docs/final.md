## Summary of the Project
The goal of our project is to take in a song as input and create a noteblock representation of that song in Minecraft. The input is any audio file chosen by the user. The Minecraft representation of the song consists of a series of note blocks connected into a redstone circuit that plays the completed song when powered. The type of Minecraft block that is placed underneath each note block determines the sound that the note block creates. In order to make our representation of the input song sound as close as possible to the original, we are using machine learning algorithms to choose the correct type of block to place under each note.
