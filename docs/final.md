## Summary of the Project
From its in-game soundtrack to jukeboxes and noteblocks, Minecraft’s music is an iconic component of the game’s history. A quick YouTube search demonstrates the popularity of Minecraft’s music with the top videos garnering hundreds of millions of views. Minecraft noteblock circuit videos are no exception to this phenomenon as millions of viewers show up to listen to the Minecraft rendition of their favorite song. In addition to the actual songs, tutorials about creating noteblock circuits that replicate various songs are also immensely prevalent, illustrating the demand for this type of content. However, while detailing the steps that are necessary to create noteblock circuits, these videos also note that the creation process often takes many hours to even days in order to complete. Therefore the construction of a product that enables users to enjoy their favorite songs within the beauty of Minecraft’s music without the exorbitant time sink is one that is not only practical but also fills a massive demand.\

The goal of our project is to take in a song as input and create a noteblock representation of that song in Minecraft. The input is any audio file chosen by the user. The Minecraft representation of the song consists of a series of note blocks connected into a redstone circuit that plays the completed song when powered. The type of Minecraft block that is placed underneath each note block determines the sound that the note block creates. In order to make our representation of the input song sound as close as possible to the original, we are using machine learning algorithms to choose the correct type of block to place under each note.\

## Approaches
To generate data for this project, we sent in an audio file into AnthemScore, which is a software that uses neural networks to generate spectrograms, sheet music, and other interesting types of data. We mainly focused on the spectrograms and the xml files in our project to give us a better understanding of what kind of sounds are occurring at what point in the audio file. After retrieving the spectrogram data, we parsed the data so that we only have data for the intervals we are interested in. We did this by using a simple formula:
    Seconds per 16th note = 15 / BPM 
The value we get from this formula will indicate how many rows we would need to skip by, since each row of the csv file indicates a hundredth of a second. 

One approach we tried was to send the values of the csv file into multiple Random Forest Classifiers to train the classifier on when an instrument is being played. To do this, we first generated test audio data from a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) called Ableton. Then, we send it to AnthemScore to generate the csv file, and parse it as mentioned before. Then we created an excel sheet that indicates when each instrument was being played on 16th note intervals for all of the samples. Then we use this data with the data from the csv file to train a Random Forest Classifier for each instrument sound that is in Minecraft. Lastly, we passed in the test audio file, which was the song “Seven Nation Army” from the band The White Stripes, into AnthemScore to get our “x” values to predict from.

One of the first tasks that we had to accomplish was to be able to detect when each note of a song was being played. The first way that was attempted to do this was by looking at the xml representation of the song produced by anthem score. The approach that was taken when analyzing the csv file representation of the song from Anthemscore was to extract the maximum amplitude that was recorded at each millisecond of the audio file. This data could then be visualized as a graph of amplitude over time. In this approach, the local maxima in the graph would be the time that a note was played, and the frequency corresponding to the column in the csv file would be the frequency of the note that was played. This approach in identifying specific notes of a song produced an audio representation that was unrecognizable as the original song, so we had to take a different approach using the xml file.

## Evaluation
 Again, getting a spot-on quantitative evaluation of our project is a tough task. Since we are limited with what kind of instrument, tempo, and meter we can use, we are limited with what we can evaluate as well. Since we used the YouTube video, it’s impossible to tell exactly when each instrument is being played, but we can get a good estimate with a little bit of music knowledge. We created an excel sheet for the expected values for each instrument, and compared them with the output of the Random Forest Classifiers to get an estimate of the accuracy of our models. We were able to achieve an overall accuracy of 91%, but despite its accuracy, the song was still unrecognizable in some parts. However, although it was not a perfect model, we believe that the performance could be improved by using more test data. 

On the qualitative aspect, the song generated by the model is recognizable, at best. Initially, we attempted to decipher which notes were being played by inspecting the spectrogram generated by AnthemScore, but after adding multiple instruments into the picture this became more difficult to do, and the songs on Minecraft became more and more unrecognizable. For this reason, we proceeded to rely on AnthemScore’s xml file, which had more accurate predictions of the pitches of the notes. The famous bass line of the song is audible, but the subtler vocals are more scattered and less accurate. However we believe that with more training data, the performance of the classifier could be boosted even more.
