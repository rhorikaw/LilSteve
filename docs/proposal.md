## Summary of the Project





## AI/ML Algorithms
For our project, we plan on using recurrent neural networks in order to generate the music blocks that will create the desired audio in minecraft. Recently, recurrent neural networks have become immensely popular in the field of machine learning due to their effectiveness in modeling sequence-to-sequence learning. This means that recurrent neural networks are very useful in areas such as speech recognition, translation, and speech synthesis, which all have to do with audio generation. This is due to the fact that recurrent neural networks use sequential data, which allows them to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior in order to solve temporal problems. Therefore, we believe that the task of translating from music in the real world to note blocks in Minecraft would be best solved using recurrent neural networks.
