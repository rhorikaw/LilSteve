## Summary of the Project

For this project, we wish to create a program that takes a song chosen by the user and constructs a Minecraft note block circuit that reproduces the song. The input to the system is an audio file which is less than five minutes. Our output is a Minecraft circuit complete with redstone, repeaters, and note blocks that when activated, produces the input audio in Minecraft. To make our output sound more like the input, we will also be using different Minecraft blocks underneath the note blocks, which changes the type of sound the note block produces by changing the instrument that is played. A possible application of our project is a song recognition app for a smartphone.
